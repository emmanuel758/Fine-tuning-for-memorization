## Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for Memory-Based Responses
This repository contains the code and resources for fine-tuning a GPT-2 model to improve its ability to respond based on a custom dataset. The goal is to enhance the model's memorization capabilities and integrate it into a web application via APIs. The fine-tuning process focuses on adjusting the model to provide accurate and context-aware responses, specifically tailored to the input data.

## Features:
Fine-tuning GPT-2 on custom Q&A datasets.
API integration using FastAPI for generating responses.
Easy deployment for web applications.
